# Exam Mark Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements an exam mark prediction model using Linear Regression with multiple variables. It involves loading and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, segregating features and labels, training the linear regression model, and making predictions for custom input values.

Key features include:  
- Data loading and preprocessing using pandas.  
- Detecting and handling missing values in the dataset.  
- Splitting the dataset into input features (X) and output labels (Y).  
- Training a Linear Regression model with sklearn.  
- Predicting exam marks based on input features.  
- Displaying prediction results for custom input values.

This project demonstrates fundamental machine learning steps for regression problems using Linear Regression.
