# Salary Estimation using K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)

This project implements a salary estimation model using the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm. It involves loading and preprocessing the dataset, mapping salary data to binary values, splitting data into training and testing sets, scaling features, and selecting the best K value for the model.

Key features include:
- Data loading and preprocessing using pandas and numpy.
- Binary encoding of salary categories.
- Train-test split for model validation.
- Feature scaling to normalize input data.
- Model training and error analysis to find the optimal K.
- Salary prediction for new input data points.
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy score.

This project demonstrates fundamental machine learning steps for classification problems using KNN.
