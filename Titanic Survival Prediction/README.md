# Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Naive Bayes

A simple machine learning project that predicts Titanic passenger survival outcomes using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Features include data cleaning, preprocessing (age, class, sex, fare), model training, and evaluation on real Titanic data.

- **Algorithm:** Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- **Inputs:** Age, Passenger Class (Pclass), Sex, Fare  
- **Output:** Survival prediction (0 or 1)
- 
Key features of this project include:
- Preprocessing of Titanic passenger data to handle missing values and convert gender to numeric form.
- Selecting key features: Age, Passenger Class (Pclass), Sex, and Fare for model training.
- Splitting the data into training and test sets for reliable evaluation.
- Using the Naive Bayes algorithm to build a simple, interpretable model for binary survival prediction.

The project demonstrates essential steps in a classification pipeline and serves as a starting point for exploring more advanced machine learning approaches on tabular datasets.
